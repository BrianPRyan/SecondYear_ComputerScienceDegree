                <p>Teachers who follow @ictedu on social networks know the annual ICT in Education Conference always reframes ideas about teaching and learning in very interesting ways.<br>

                    On Saturday the 23rd of April, the focus of the 2016 event spotlights “Students as Co-Creators” with second and third level students presenting workshops on how they find creative spaces, the creative workflow they’ve adopted while innovating and sharing.<br> 

                    Both the keynote speaker, Professor Steve Wheeler, and the capstone speaker, Mary Carty, will share their perspectives of effective collaboration with conference attendees. Steve Wheeler’s long-standing appreciation of immersive learning with electronic tools has influenced a generation of teachers. <br> 
                    Mary Carty’s passion for experiential entrepreneurship connects directly to processes of ideation and prototyping that several of the student-led workshops will demonstrate. Mary’s hands-on passion for STEM and start-ups will show students and teachers how good ideas can germinate into new business ideas. <br> 

                    In the months preceding the 2016 ICT in Education Conference, 36 third level students will create animations, short videos and short stories that offer a glimpse of what the day-long conference will showcase. <br> 
                    Students will master important elements of Design Thinking while producing captivating pieces of content for both online promotion of @ictedu and on display screens during the main event. Teachers attending the conference can take away Design Thinking worksheets that could complement their own teaching practices.</p>
